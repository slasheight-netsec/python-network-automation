# python-network-automation
Home of network automation scripts I write in python.

Goal is to start with automating basic discovery tasks (i.e. finding vlans, checking existing configs for best practice, pulling hardware/software info.), then create configuration scripts. Eventually scripts should be able to take subnets as input, and export results to spreadsheet.
